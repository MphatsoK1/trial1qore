Mphunzitsi AI — ML Integration Module
Overview

This module integrates Machine Learning (ML) capabilities into Mphunzitsi AI, the intelligent learning assistant designed for Malawi’s education system.
It focuses on enabling speech-to-text, speech recognition, and natural language processing (NLP) to enhance learner interaction, pronunciation feedback, and dynamic responses.

 Components

Speech-to-Text Engine – Converts spoken input into text using a pre-trained model (e.g., Whisper, SpeechRecognition API).

Speech Recognition & NLP – Understands learner input, classifies intent, and generates feedback or instructions using NLP models.

Feedback Loop – Provides real-time spoken or visual responses based on student interaction.
